# cisProject
Group project for CIS3270
This application is a collaborative effort between Harry Dulaney(Jordan Lightgate), David Kelly, and Logan Lee (khantlin). 
The goal of this project was to write a desktop application which behaves like a reservation system for searching and booking flights.
The only constraints where that we must use Java SDK 8, JDBC, and MySQL.
